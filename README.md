Given an array arr, find element pairs whose sum equal the second argument arg and return the sum of their indices. - **Pairwise.js**

Create a function that takes two or more arrays and returns an array of their symmetric difference. The returned array must contain only unique values (no duplicates). - **symmetric_difference.js**

Compare and update the inventory stored in a 2D array against a second 2D array of a fresh delivery. Update the current existing inventory item quantities (in arr1). If an item cannot be found, add the new item and quantity into the inventory array. The returned inventory array should be in alphabetical order by item. - **updateInventory.js**

The aim of the game is to arrange four numbers in a way that when evaluated, the result is 24. Implement a function that takes a string of four digits as its argument, with each digit from 1 to 9 (inclusive) with repetitions allowed, and returns an arithmetic expression that evaluates to the number 24. If no such solution exists, return "no solution exists". - **solve24.js**

Return the number of total permutations of the provided string that don't have repeated consecutive letters. Assume that all characters in the provided string are each unique.
- **No_Repeats.js**

There are 100 doors in a row that are all initially closed. You make 100 passes by the doors. The first time through, visit every door and 'toggle' the door (if the door is closed, open it; if it is open, close it). Implement a function to determine the state of the doors after the last pass. Return the final result in an array, with only the door number included in the array if it is open. - **100_doors.js**
